# ProjectionClustering

The idea is to create clustering method that:

- uses LLMs to use rules to find similar and dissimilar items within a few samples of the texts
- the embeddings of those pairs are used to find the directions of the similar texts
- using the projections of the texts in the directions, the texts are clustered
